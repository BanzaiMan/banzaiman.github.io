<p>Earlier this year, I gave a talk with this title at
<a href="http://christchurch.ruby.org.nz/">Christchurch Ruby</a>.</p>

<p>Later, I had an opportunity to refine that talk.
This post walks you through the ideas presented.</p>

<h2>Once upon a time…</h2>

<p>Every developer nowadays should know what &ldquo;regular expressions&rdquo;
(henceforth regex) are.
But not a lot of them know where regexes came from.</p>

<p>In order to explain the genesis of regex, we need to step back and
review formal language theory.</p>

<h2>Just enough formal language theory</h2>

<p>In a branch of mathematical logic called formal language theory, there
is no semantics.
Just forms.</p>

<p>A languages <em>L</em> consists of words, which consists of letters in an alphabet <em>Σ</em>.
Devoid of semantics, a language can be finite (in terms of the number of words
belonging to it), but finite languages are not very interesting.</p>

<p>Then, one can consider describing a language by succinctly providing a
test to determine whether or not a string of letters in <em>Σ</em> is a valid
word in <em>L</em>.
This is basically what an &lsquo;expression&rsquo; is.</p>

<p>While constructing an expression, you can denote closure under
concatenation; a string of letters is a word in <em>L</em> if that string is
&lsquo;repeated&rsquo; at least once.
This</p>
